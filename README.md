This is a project
- Author: Chenyu Xi
- Check <a href="https://dry-mountain-33107.herokuapp.com/">my heroku website</a>

# Explanations:
- I did this project as a notebook website, however I didn't implement a user system currently, I might do it in the future.
- I use a not smart way using jquery to create the plugin bar. 
The extension already offers two great functions. I wrote the rest buttons, and I skip the upload file(it's a fake button since server cannot deal with large file) and use a stupid way to add music, 
i.e. create href for music
- Meanwhile, the MathJax sdk is not compatible well with the plugin, in some rare case the math equation will disappear
- I implement add table button in two place, one use sdk, one is dummy version in plugin tool bar
