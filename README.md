# Explanations:
- I did this project as a notebook website, however I didn't implement a user system currently, I might do it in the future
- I use a not smart way using jquery to create the plugin bar. 
The extension already offers two great functions. I wrote the rest buttons.
- Meanwhile, the MathJax sdk is not compatible well with the plugin, in some rare case the math equation will disappear
- I implement add table button in two place, one is in plugin tool bar by myself and one is better using some third party package
- If you want to run server locally, change the LOCAL_TEST to true in setting.py
